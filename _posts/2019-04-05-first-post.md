title: An initiation into endless possibilities

  At the end of my first week in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, some musings about what lays ahead
</div>

**By design, Python is a pretty intuitive coding language.** But with any language, it takes time, care, and a willingness to make mistakes in order to really become fluent. Also with any language, there comes a moment when you finally feel like you're in the flow, when you can start to intuit things, when you can think several steps ahead. I don't think I'm quite there yet, but just like how animals can sense when an earthquake is coming, I too can sense that this seismic shift is afoot for me. I can almost smell it.

This in itself would be enough to buoy me into next week of the bootcamp, but that's not even the most exciting thing from this week. What's gotten me really excited is my unfolding understanding and awareness of the seemingly infinite possibilities that will become open to me once I've finished all 12 weeks. In this first week, we focused on utilizing Python Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and it's been what I consider -- at the risk of being overly dramatic -- life-changing. The ease with which you can use Python to clean, slice, group, and manipulate data with just a few lines of code is exhilarating, particularly when compared to the slog of data manipulation in programs like Microsoft Excel. Even with a relatively robust knowledge of VBA, the coding language that can be used to automate processes in Excel, data cleaning and manipulation tasks in that stalwart of spreadsheet can be pain-staking and slow-going. But with Python, the possibilities seem endless. I don't think I've felt this kind of thrill of endless possibilities since I was a wee child. And it feels good.

**Week 2, I'm coming for you.**
